 *
 * You can only interact from the editor and the console.
 * You want to have the console open at all time, so do that first.
 *
 * This website is built upon the Github API.
 * If you are not login, your API calls are limited to 60 per hours
 * and you can't store your progress.
 *
 * You can signin here for free if you don't already have an account :
 * -> https://github.com/join
 *
 * All API calls are in HTTPS so your password is not vulnerable.
 * If you still feel uneasy, you can make a trash account just for this.
 *
 * You can check all the api calls I do here :
